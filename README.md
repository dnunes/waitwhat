WaitWhat?!
==========
### Don't ever get confused about the execution again.

No more multiple calls for log and error reporter. WaitWhat supports multiple underlying engines and callbacks for context storage and error reporting.

Still in early stages and implemented with Winston custom output, will be extended in the future for other engines. No test coverage at all, but simple enough so that you don't need to worry too much by now.
